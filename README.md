# Hamster Travel

This is a second take on my personal travel planner that we as a family use since 2014. This new version is a full rewrite of the old project and is under active development right now (deployed on [https://hamster-travel.fly.dev](https://hamster-travel.fly.dev) right now). You can read a bit more about planned features on my [personal website](https://www.amarchenko.de/hamster-travel/).

The old version is still in use and available on [https://travel.hmstr.rocks](https://travel.hmstr.rocks/en/landing) (source code for this version is also on [github](https://github.com/anmarchenko/hamster_travel_legacy)).
